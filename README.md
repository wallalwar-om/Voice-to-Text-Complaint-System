## 📖 Scenario

This project simulates a complaint management system in a team-based environment where multiple admins may be operating from different locations (e.g., branch offices, campuses, or local offices).

To ensure a structured hierarchy and secure management:

- A **Superadmin** must be registered first.
- Without a Superadmin, no other admin can be registered or access the system.
- This allows central control and prevents unauthorized or premature access.
- Admins can be promoted to Superadmin only by an existing Superadmin.

This setup ensures secure bootstrapping and strict role-based access in decentralized environments.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎙️ **Voice-to-Text Complaint Submission**
  - Users record or upload an audio complaint
  - Speech is transcribed to text using speech recognition
  - Complaint is stored in MongoDB Atlas along with metadata

- 📋 **Complaint Validation**
  - If transcription fails (e.g., music file or unclear input), the user sees an error message
  - Users can **delete invalid complaints themselves** if transcription fails

- 🧑‍💼 **Admin & Superadmin Dashboard**
  - View all complaints with metadata (category, date, status)
  - Play back audio directly on the dashboard
  - Promote admins to superadmins
  - Filter complaints by category/status

  - Admin_dash

  - Superadmin_dash
  [App Screenshot](./assets/admin_dash_superadmin.png)

- 🌐 **Public Complaint Feed**
  - Displays **5–10 most recent complaints** on the homepage
  - Each complaint card shows:
    - Category (tag)
    - Submission date
    - Audio transcription preview
    - Complaint status (e.g., `Under Review`)
    - Delete option (if failed)

- 🌓 **User Interface Enhancements**
  - Responsive layout with modern card-based UI
  - Dark/Light mode support
  - Minimalist top nav with links to:
    - Submit Complaint
    - Admin Panel
    - Dashboard

## 🧪 Getting Started Locally

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- MongoDB installed locally or access to MongoDB Atlas

### 🐍 Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vtt-complaint-system.git
cd vtt-complaint-system
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create `.env` file and add the following:
```env
MONGO_URI=your_local_or_atlas_mongodb_uri
SECRET_KEY=your_flask_secret_key
DATABASE_NAME=your_database_name (if using local mongodb)
```

```Alter code (if using local mongodb)
Uncomment this lines

# DATABASE = os.getenv('DATABASE')
# db = client[DATABASE]
```

5. Run the application:
```bash
python run.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000` to use the app.

## 🌍 Hosting & Deployment

- **Backend:** Hosted on [Render](https://render.com/)
- **Database:** [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
    - Free 512 MB tier for testing (~10 days usage with moderate audio & metadata storage)
    - Atlas auto-pauses during inactivity, wakes on access

> ⚠️ **Security Warning:** Avoid hardcoding credentials. Use `.env` variables and keep them secure.

To use MongoDB locally, [download and install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community), start the server, and use:
```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
```
